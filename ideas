- live spectrogram/envelope/amplitude (EQ?) column effect - tests microphone
  - automatically detect microphone problems - too much silence, too much gain, etc
- single HMM, instead of GMM+HMM
- adversary generating speech with vocoder?
  - that's what other factor is for
- send FLAC (lossless, supports more resolutions than ALAC)
- keep asking words until confidence threshold is reached or we hit max words - allows us to accept/fail early for high confidence
- present one word at a time, no keyboard/mouse input required
- send mobile code to phone on failure, or present user with security questions
- three attempts before moving on to the next word automatically; record failures
- use WordNet to eliminate words with negative/sexual connotations
- WebRTC, but with perfect QoS over WebSockets - custom buffering
- use speaker adaptation for speech recognition part (assume speaker is authenticating user)
- progress bar for training/login
- say/press "skip", "pause", "resume", "restart"
- show spinny gif for processing individual words, running speaker recognition at the end
- skip automatically after 5 seconds or so; don't advance progress bar
- if login fails, user must re-enter password

- emit test sound (pink noise?) to correct for environment (room) acoustics, establish lower bound for surrounding noise
- longer phrases - only possible once pronunciation evaluation is implemented
